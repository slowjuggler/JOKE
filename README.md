1. Description.

Throwing objects is a rather frivolous activity. However, it also has its own mathematical laws and physical limitations. This very little
code allows us to evaluate that there is a limit to the minimum heigh at which objects can be thrown and why it is quite difficult to juggle
a large number of objects for a long time. And this is due not only to the reaction and speed, but also the accuracy of the throws.
Details are in the comments to the code. The calculations are based on Claude Shannon's thereoms (pdf document is in the repository).

2. Installation

On Linux compile the software using "make".
